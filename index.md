## About me

Hi there! I am Manyi Yim, currently a postdoctoral researcher at SMU. I am passionate about applying mathematical and computational models to address problems, and developing innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving. Here I would like to share with you some of the projects I have been working on.

I am currently exploring new opportunities in the fields of Mathematical/Computational Modeling, Machine Learning and Data Science. I would love to talk about ideas. [Give me a shout: manyi.yim@gmail.com](manyi.yim@gmail.com).
