## About me

Hi there! I am Manyi Yim, currently a postdoctoral researcher at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. Curious about human intelligence, animal cognition and how the brains work, I have been studying biological neural networks to gain insight into brain functions. Additionally I am fascinated by the powers of artificial neural networks, especially in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. In my free time, I have been updating myself with the latest advancement on machine learning (ML), and working on my own ML projects. I am passionate about applying mathematical and computational models to address problems, and developing innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving. 

Here I would like to share with you some of the projects I have been working on. Give me a shout: [manyi.yim@gmail.com](manyi.yim@gmail.com).
