## Correlations in weights in pretrained small language models

### Abstract

Motivation:

Methods:

Observations:

Plans:
1. Study how the correlation structures evolve during training by looking into different checkpoints
2. Examine the changes of the correlation structures upon fine-tuning
3. 
4. Investigate the correlation structures in larger language models

The firing rate of a LIF neuron receiving a Gaussian distributed noise is known analytically:
