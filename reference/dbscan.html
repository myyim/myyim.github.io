I was given the LPFC neural activity data collected from macaques in a decision-making task (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319304854"> Yim et. al., 2019 </a>).
We wanted to know how the activity of those neurons changed during task and whether some neurons responded in a similar manner. 
We had developed a minimal computational model that could "perform" the task as the animals did.
We determined the essential features based on the model and extracted the four features from each LPFC neuron.
Each neuron can be represented by one point in the 4D space.

Do they form clusters? Seems so. Do all neurons belong to a cluster? Seems not. There is noise.
